# Game Analytics AB Service

This library is an A/B testing wrapper over the existing Game Analytics library, providing typing support and default values.

To get started with the Game Analytics AB Service, you must initialise GameAnalytics the usual way, and then construct a new GameAnalyticsABService.

```ts
GameAnalytics.initialize({
	gameKey: "GAME-KEY",
	secretKey: "SECRET-KEY",
	build: "1.0.0",
});

new GameAnalyticsABService<"music" | "ad-location">(
	{
		music: "Bossa Me (a)",
		"ad-location": "top-left",
	},
	(player, values) => {
		// do something with the loaded values
	},
);
```
